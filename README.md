Files used for [parsec.ro](https://www.parsec.ro) website.

Raw data are parsed from Jonathan McDowell's [GCAT](https://planet4589.org/space/gcat/), then parsed by Python into a few Markdown files, used by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate the final, static HTML form. A slighty modified version of [hugo-alageek-theme](https://github.com/gkmngrgn/hugo-alageek-theme) is used for coating.
